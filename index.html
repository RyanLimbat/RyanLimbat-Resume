        <div class="subheading mb-5">History</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ryan Limbat, and I am currently in my senior year of college at the University of California, Riverside. 
My life is still a work in progress. Not in a negative tone, but rather I have more interests and ideas I want to explore. Especially since my upbringing from childhood, I had always wished to become a proper individual when I grow up. My family wasn't well off, but they also weren't at the financial bottom. Rather, my family and I are considered middle-class level. However, at a young age, I was taught to be project humble and proper characteristics to those around me. Also, I was taught that hard work was is a product of endurance and training; rather than the brainchild of granted wishing. Because of this ideology, I had dedicated my life to accomplish my ultimate goal of becoming the most proficient version of myself and only myself. 
<br><br>

        In order to achieve my goal, I had done my part of both volunteer and employed work. Based on what I had conducted and acquired from these jobs, I can safely say I have strengthened and reforged my grit and motivation to continue my path to follow my own path and seek for more opportunities as both a learner and a seeker. Speaking of learning, I mentioned earlier that I am a college student in his last year of university. I declared myself to be a History major, for the purpose of researching past events, fact-check theoretical opinions, and critically challenging current and past trends. My fascination with American History was the true decider of my college major, due to how rich and immersive the world of American nostalgia and life is to the average person. I am a very positive person who is very outgoing and aiding to those who are in need. Especially if there is an opportunity to help a colleague or customer, I am more than willing to provide my time and service to give the best impression for both myself and the company I am working dutifully for. 
<br><br>

       For my skills and talents for the work place, I have the ability to engage in a topic and/or subject that requires extensive research and fact checking. Also, I am capable of operating technical tasks that require physical action and labor. My mission is to help a company, and become a valuable and productive figure for everyone that is working around me. I am a confident person in heart, as I believe that confidence is the main driver to achieving the impossible -- especially during harsh and treacherous times. With my knowledge and practices I learned from working, volunteering, and educational knowledge; I can more than assure any employers reading this, that I can provide the proper services in need, as well as participating in helping my fellow colleagues and customers to quality time and service. I promise that I can get the job done and efficiently, and I can safely bet on it.
